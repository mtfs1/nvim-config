# About this repo

This repo exists to save my configurations on neovim. It has the content of the directory "~/.config/nvim/", and I intend to save things here for easy migration between computers or OS instalations. Feel free for replicating it or utilizing it.

For each plugin installed with Packer that requires specific configuration, a file in "after" directory is created. The file is intended to be run with the "source" command, and not be required by another file.
